## Hi, I'm Kevin Ishimwe

I am a self-taught software developer from Rwanda with a strong focus on

Despite limited resources, I have independently designed and implemented
production-style web applications, including online learning platforms
with live classrooms and automated assessments.

### Technical Skills
- Backend: PHP, MySQL
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Real-time Systems: WebSocket, WebRTC
- System Design: Authentication, Role-based Access, Database Modeling

### Selected Projects
- Online School Platform (Live Classroom, Assessments, Auto-Grading)

### Current Objective
To pursue a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering or Computer Science
through a fully funded international scholarship, and later specialize in
Artificial Intelligence and intelligent systems.

### Long-Term Vision
To build scalable and intelligent digital platforms that improve access
to education and information in low-resource environments.
