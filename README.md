Despite coming from a low-income background, I have independently designed
and built multiple full-stack web systems focused on education and content
delivery.

## Featured Projects
- **Online School & Live Classroom Platform**
  - Real-time virtual classrooms with automated assessments
- **Deeply Research IJD – News & Research CMS**

## Current Goal
To pursue a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering / Computer Science
through a fully funded international scholarship, and later specialize in
Artificial Intelligence for intelligent educational systems.

## Long-Term Vision
To build scalable, intelligent platforms that improve access to quality
education in low-resource environments.
